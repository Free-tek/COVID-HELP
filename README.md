# COVID-HELP
We started FREETEK because we wanted to make the next second ⏱ humans spend on earth better than the last, yea like the second that just passed now.

We wanted to do more than sending you a mail to stay indoors, wash your hands and use a face mask. We wanted to be in thesame room with you so we survive this pandemic together, we want to be sure you are safe.
